# instant-messaging-system
This C++ program implements a simple client-server chat application with functionalities like user registration, login, sending messages, adding friends, viewing friend list, and viewing message history. It utilizes sockets for communication and includes features for encryption and multi-threading.

1. Introduction:
      Client-server architecture is a fundamental concept in network programming, where clients communicate with a central server to exchange data. In this tutorial, we'll use this architecture to build a basic chat                application. The server will handle connections from multiple clients and facilitate communication between them.

2. Setting up the Project:
      Before diving into the code, ensure you have a basic understanding of socket programming in C++. You'll need a C++ compiler and an IDE or text editor for coding.

3. Client Side Implementation:
      Let's start by implementing the client side of our chat application. The client will connect to the server, send commands, and receive messages. Key components include:

      Client Class: Handles socket creation, connection to the server, and sending/receiving messages.
      Main Function: Manages user interaction, allowing registration, login, message sending, and other operations.
4. Server Side Implementation:
      Next, we'll implement the server side. The server will handle incoming client connections, manage user accounts, and facilitate message exchange. Key components include:

      User Management: Handles user registration, login, and friend management. It encrypts passwords for security.
      Network Handler: Manages incoming client connections, message handling, and friend requests.
5. Conclusion:
      In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of building a client-server chat application in C++. While this application is simple, it provides a foundation for more complex messaging systems. Further enhancements could        include user authentication, message encryption, and a more robust user interface.

Summary:
      By following this tutorial, you've learned how to create a basic client-server chat application in C++. This project demonstrates key concepts of network programming, including socket communication, multi-threading,          and user management. Experiment with the code, explore additional features, and continue building your networking skills.
